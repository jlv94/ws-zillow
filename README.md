Hello!

This is my first complete project in python to feed a database from webscrapping.


This script scraps real estate site Zillow for properties and their data in any city listed.


Note:
Build a first version of the scrip, I figured out that the website uses Dynamic CSS. The script is there build in two parts:
1. A script to get the class name of the tags needed in the scrapping. Because of a Dynamic CSS structure, the name class changes overtime.
2. Once the current class name stored in list, the script iterate over those tags of all the page found for a requested city. The data is then cleaned and appended in a database.

For any enquiry over this project, please contact me at jonathanverschaeve94@gmail.com
